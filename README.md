# HoopsMM

**HoopsMM** is the first large‑scale **multitask multimodal** benchmark for NCAA Division I men’s basketball.  

It aligns four rich data modalities: box‑score features, play‑by‑play logs, GPT‑generated narratives, and betting odds—across **19,739 games (2021–2025)** and provides unified code for three core tasks:

| Task | Goal | Metric |
|---|---|---|
| Pre‑game Win Probability | Binary classification of home‑team victory | Accuracy, F1, ROC‑AUC |
| Capital Allocation | Backtest fixed‑stake & Kelly strategies | ROI, volatility, risk‑of‑ruin |
| Season‑long Ranking | End‑of‑season team ordering | Weighted accuracy, top‑$k$ accuracy |
